# Unity-Github-Action
A repository to showcase github action with Unity. The Unity project is empty.
Don't forget to change the Unity version in each .yml if you use my files !

This repository has three workflows :
- "activation.yml" which needs to be executed at the start of your project to get your license and set the "UNITY_LICENSE" variable in github secret. ðŸ”‘
- "test.yml" which verifies for each push that your project run all of its unit tests right, and that the project can be built. âš™ 
- "build.yml" which is executed when creating a new release, testing once again your Unity project, and then building it for Windowsx64, and attaching the .zip to your release. ðŸ”¨
